# 800x600

Chrome extension that monitors img tags on the page and replaces their images with ones that show the dimensions of the originals.

## Features
  - replaces all images from img tags even dynamically added
  - renders the replacement image locally
  - works per tab
  - replaces images when they are loaded, so if the server returns 404, the image won't be replaced and you could see the problem
